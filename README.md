# Ellie - My All-in-One Command Line Buddy 🚀

Hey there! Meet **Ellie**—my personal command-line companion designed to take the hassle out of system management and automation. I’m **Tachera Sasi**, and I built Ellie for... well, me! But guess what? You get to use her too. Whether it’s managing services, showing off system info, or tinkering with files, Ellie’s got your back.

## Why Ellie?

Ever thought, *“Ugh, why do I need to remember a million commands just to manage my system?”* Same here. That’s why I created Ellie—to make everything simpler, faster, and cooler.

### What Can Ellie Do?
- Start and stop services like Apache and MySQL in a flash
- Flex your system info because why not?
- Create, list, and manage files without leaving the terminal
- Handle network stuff like connecting to Wi-Fi
- Configure Git because you can’t escape Git
- Install and update packages effortlessly
